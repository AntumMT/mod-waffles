This mod adds waffles, as well as wafflemakers and batter. The waffle batter  
is put into the waffles maker, cooked, and turns into a waffle. That waffle  
can then turn into 4 smaller waffles.  


**Mod Contains:**
*	Wafflemaker
*	Large Waffle
*	Small Waffle
*	Waffle Batter (in a can)
	
**How it Works:**
*   Place a wafflemaker
*	Punch it to open
*	Hold a can of batter, and punch the wafflemaker
*	Punch again to close
*	After 5 seconds, the wafflemaker will open with a cooked waffle
*	Punch again to retrieve waffle
	
**Important stuff:**
*	A can of waffle batter can only be used 3 times
*	The wafflemaker produces a *large* waffle, which gives you 8 hp  
	(4 hearts) when eaten
*	The large waffle can be placed in your crafting grid to produce  
	4 *smaller* waffles.
*	Each small waffle gives you 2 hp (one heart)

**Crafting:**

*	Waffle Maker:  
S = Steel Ingot   C = Copper Ingot   F = Furnace  
|S||S||S|  
|C||F|  
|S||S||S|  
(reverse works aswell)  

*	Waffle Maker Alternate (if Homedecor is present)	
PS = Plastic Sheet   PC = Power Crystal   C = Copper Strip   H = Heating Element  
|PS||PS||PS|  
|PC|  
|C ||H ||PS|  
(reverse works aswell)  

*	Waffle Batter  
F = Flour   B = Bucket with Water  
|F|  
|F|  
|B|  
(can go anywhere in grid as long as they are above each other and in that   order)  

There are separate models, but only one is obtainable from the creative inventory.
**DO NOT** place waffles:wafflemaker_closed_full if you have used /giveme. It is
not diggable and can only be removed with worldedit or an admin pick.
